Proposition 1:

Long ago, a great war broke out between 'earths' four elements of water, earth, air, and fire. This war brought chaos to the lands of 'earth' and almost lead to the extinction of all life until one man sought to end this war. By using the power taken from the Elementals, he was able to form the 'Sacred Gem', and sealed away the Elementals. With that brought peace to the lands of 'earth'.

 Skip ahead 200 years and we find the 'Sacred Gem' in the hands of an evil cult, who have just gotten their hands on it. Now in their possession, they perform a ritual on it, breaking it and as such removing the seal that has kept the peace for hundreds of years. 

The world starts going into chaos as tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic activity, and hurricanes all start occuring nearby the shrines the Elementals have been resting in.

Our protagonist of the story, 'Pork' is first found exploring the woods, when he see's a shooting star coming down from the sky. It lands closeby, so he chooses to investigate. At the crash site, 'Pork' finds a mysterious being that is injured from the crash but is still alive. He chooses to take it home to take care of it.

This mysterious being introduces itself as 'john' and explains to 'Pork' that the elements have awoken from their slumber, and so will start tearing the world apart unless they can be stopped.  'John' gives 'Pork' all of his power, and as such becomes one with 'Pork'.

Together, they fight against the Elementals, carving a path to a safe future.
